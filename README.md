# An Electron desktop application secured by MSAL Node on Microsoft identity platform

This sample demonstrates how to use [MSAL Node](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/tree/dev/lib/msal-node) to sign-in a user and acquire an access token for a protected resource such as Microsoft Graph in an Electron desktop application using the [authorization code grant with PKCE](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow) flow.

## Features

This sample demonstrates the following **MSAL Node** concepts:

* Configuration
* Login and logout
* Acquiring an access token
* Calling a web API

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) must be installed to run this sample.
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) is recommended for running and editing this sample.

### Setup

1. Register a [desktop app that calls web APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/scenario-desktop-app-registration) in the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com).
    * Navigate to the **Authentication** blade in the app registration.
    * Select **Add a platform** and choose **Mobile and Desktop application**
    * For the **redirect URI**, enter `msal://redirect` into the input box.
1. Clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-javascript-nodejs-desktop.git`
1. Open the [.env](.env) file and provide the required configuration values.
    1. Replace the string `Enter_the_Application_Id_Here` with your app/client ID on Azure AD portal.
    1. Replace the string `Enter_the_Tenant_Info_Here` with your tenant ID on Azure AD portal.
    1. Replace the string `Enter_the_Cloud_Instance_Id_Here` with `https://login.microsoftonline.com/` (see **note** below).
    1. Replace the string `Enter_the_Graph_Endpoint_Here`. with `https://graph.microsoft.com/` (see **note** below).
